# Volume Gesture Control

This project allows you to control your system's volume using hand gestures captured via a webcam. The project uses OpenCV for video capture and gesture detection, along with Pycaw to interact with the system's audio.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection.
- Adjusts system volume based on thumb and index finger distance.
- Displays volume percentage and frames per second (FPS).
